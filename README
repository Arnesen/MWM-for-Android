This is Craig's custom MetaWatch Manager.

It's based on the official MetaWatch manager (see README.orig)

New in this version:
- Extended support to Android 2.2 (FroYo)
- Changed music update to single 500ms buzz
- Marked shared variables as volatile to improve thread safety
- Changed send buffer to a BlockingQueue to improve thread safety

Questions, comments, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome.  
I'm PurpleGuitar on the MetaWatch forums.
