This is benjymous' fork of the MetaWatch Manager, based on MetaWatch OpenSource, AkiraYasha, Chris Sewell, and PurpleGuitars modifications
with some extra modifications of my own (currently just tweaks to the weather display layout)

It's based on the official MetaWatch manager (see README.orig)

phone / watch to reset, or any other of a host of unpleasant things.
