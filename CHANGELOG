v0.91:
=======================================================================

- Hopefully fixed bug that was crashing digital watches on notification.

- Hopefully fixed Gmail count display on digital watches.   


v0.9:
=======================================================================

- Digital watch only: On receiving a notification, the time to wait 
  before returning to the idle screen is now a preference. (Untested)
  [Smithers]
  
- Created a new section for settings that only apply to the digital 
  watch.
   

v0.8:
=======================================================================

- Support BeyondPod as a music player. [tilmanb]

- MWM now broadcasts an intent when the connection state changes.
  Intent: org.metawatch.manager.CONNECTION_CHANGE
  Extra: key='state' type=boolean (true if now connected, false otherwise)
  Many thanks to [rmrfchik] for submitting the code!
  

v0.7:
=======================================================================

- Added option to forward all notifications to the watch.  A new 
  settings screen is available to blacklist apps that you don't want
  to receive notifications from. (Requires accessibility in Android
  Settings) [db1nto, damis648]

- Made vibrate pattern customizable for:
  - SMS
  - Gmail
  - K9
  - Alarm
  - Music
  - Calendar
  - Other apps
  
- Added album info to music notification on digital watch.

- Created settings section for analog watch, and moved scroll delay
  into the new section.

v0.6:
=======================================================================

- Add album info to music notification for analog watch.

- Added option to pause a few seconds before scrolling OLED text.

- Scroll recipient name on analog watch for GMail messages (Android 2.3+)

- Removed debug option to right-pad short messages, since the 
  short messages bug is fixed now.

- Only add notifications to the queue if the watch is connected. [Arlanthir]


v0.5:
=======================================================================

- Implemented a host of changes to try to fix the unresponsive analog
  watch problem:

  - Low-level protocol messages are now managed by a dedicated thread
    and synchronized queue, to protect against the possibility of 
    bytes from different arrays getting mangled.
    
  - High-level notification messages are now managed by a (different)
    dedicated thread and synchronized queue, to protect against the
    possibility of arrays from different notifications getting
    mangled.
    
  - The notification processing thread no longer aborts when a 
    scrolling message shorter than the OLED screen size is sent.
    (This was the "short message" bug -- major thanks to Arlanthir,
    thescreensavers, and spacejunky for helping me track this one down!)
    
  - Numerous minor fixes to improve thread safety; making variables
    volatile, properly handling InterruptedExceptions, etc.
  
- Don't send calender events if the event text is blank.

- Suppress toasts when Bluetooth throws IOExceptions; just log them. 


v0.4:
=======================================================================

- GMail notifications are now sent only on receipt of new messages.
  This change fixes a nasty bug where the MWM wasn't distinguishing
  between new message notifications and unread count notifications, 
  causing double notifications with seemingly random numbers on the 
  watch.  Digital watch is probably fixed too, but is untested.  

- Scroll subject line of K9 notifications. [DHG703B]

- Scroll snippet line of GMail full notifications. [DHG703B]
  Note that this doesn't affect phones that can't see the content
  of GMail messages (Android 2.3 and above, I think).

- Hopefully fix calendar notification to show text on digital watch [dtiens]

- Added debug option to pad short messages with spaces,
  to help debug possible short notification issue [Arlanthir]


v0.3:
=======================================================================

- Added experimental support for Calendar events.
  (note that this requires Accessibility in Android Settings.)
  (works on analog watch, untested on digital)


v0.2:
=======================================================================

- Extended support to Android 2.2 (FroYo) [db1nto]

- Changed music update to single 500ms buzz

- Marked shared variables as volatile to improve thread safety

- Changed send buffer to a BlockingQueue to improve thread safety [spacejunky]

- Support for Android 2.3 (API level 10)

- Optionally hide notification icon in status bar

- Fix bug where newlines were displayed as boxes in analog watch

- Fix bug where GMail was displayed as SMS on analog watch

- Display Gmail unread count on analog watch
