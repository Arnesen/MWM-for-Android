TO DO
=======================================================================



WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Maybe make the call vibrate pattern an option?

- Remove cached settings in MetaWatch Service -- they don't improve performance
  noticably, they just force the user to restart the service when changes
  are saved.

- Add options to backup/restore settings to SD card. [thescreensavers]

- Notify on new voicemail?

- Optionally left-pad scrolling text on analog, to maximize the time 
  before the beginning of the message scrolls off.

- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?

- Optionally auto-start on system boot. [tilmanb]

- Review new message docs -- what new and cool things can we do?

- Add dialog to send custom messages to the watch? [db1nto]
    maybe a small form with
    - dropdown menu (for icon) + textfield for upper OLED
    - textfield for bottom OLED
    - dropdown menu for vibrating (1, 2 or 3 times)
    - checkbox for scrolling?
    - send button

- Add custom RTM handling -- is there an API?  If not, at least
  ignore syncing messages.
  
  
SOMEDAY / MAYBE
=======================================================================

- Should we wait for status change from watch before sending new notifications?
  Specifically, it looks like the watch sends a status change when it's done
  scrolling.  Maybe we should wait for that before sending a new notification
  on top of the old one.

- Scroll K9 receipient address on top OLED? [thescreensavers] (Not sure
  if this is possible; if it is, I probably can't tackle it until the
  analog message interface is published.) 

- Scroll big text on oled?  (Can't even attempt until we have the 
  analog watch message structure.)

- Control Winamp from watch?  Can this be done?  (Can't attempt until
  we get the analog docs -- does the analog watch have an application mode?)
