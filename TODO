TO DO
=======================================================================


WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Why does clicking "Start" take so long?  Maybe we should push the
  startup to a working thread?

- Create buzzing scheme:
  - 1 buzz: minor events (music track change)
  - 2 buzz: normal events (notifications, email)
  - 3 buzz: urgent events (SMS, calendar)

- Other notification types via Accessibility?
	- Pandora track changes?
	- Facebook notifications?
	- Twitter notifications?
	- Google+ notifications?
	- Parcel notifications?  "Your package has arrived!" :)
	- Turn-by-turn navigation?
	- anDGS notifications: "It's your turn to play!"
	- Remember the Milk notifications: "A task is due!"
	- Weather channel severe weather?

- Maybe just forward all notifications, with a blacklist? [db1nto]

- Scroll big text on oled?

- Notify on new voicemail?

- Low phone battery?

- Control Winamp from watch?  Can this be done?  Does the analog
  watch have an application mode?

- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?
