TO DO
=======================================================================



WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Remove pause in processNotification scrolling, replace with
  wait for watch to return "scrolling done" message?

- Scroll account name on GMail blank notifications.

- If the threading fix works, remove the right-padding option. 

- Optionally left-pad scrolling messages?  Often the beginning of
  the message has already disappeared by the time the user looks
  at the watch

- Why does clicking "Start" take so long?  Maybe we should push the
  startup to a working thread?

- Create buzzing scheme:
  - 1 buzz: minor events (music track change)
  - 2 buzz: normal events (notifications, email)
  - 3 buzz: urgent events (SMS, calendar)

- Other notification types via Accessibility?
	- Pandora track changes?
	- Facebook notifications?
	- Twitter notifications?
	- Google+ notifications?
	- Parcel notifications?  "Your package has arrived!" :)
	- Turn-by-turn navigation?
	- anDGS notifications: "It's your turn to play!"
	- Remember the Milk notifications: "A task is due!"
	- Weather channel severe weather?

- Maybe just forward all notifications, with a blacklist? [db1nto]

- Scroll big text on oled?

- Scroll album and track on music updates?
  
- Notify on new voicemail?

- Low phone battery?

- Control Winamp from watch?  Can this be done?  Does the analog
  watch have an application mode?

- Change duration of notification on analog watch -- it disappears
  too quickly.  Make it user configurable in Settings.
  NOTE: Notification duration might be controlled in the firmware, not 
        the MWM; look at Protocol.sendOledDisplay().  
  
- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?
  
- Change notification timing for analog watch -- usually by the time
  the user turns to look at the watch the beginning of the message
  has scrolled by.  Maybe have the display pause for a second or two
  before scrolling starts?
  NOTE: Scrolling behavior might be controlled in the firmware, not 
        the MWM; look at Protocol.sendOledDisplay().
