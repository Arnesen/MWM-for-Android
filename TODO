TO DO
=======================================================================




WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Change notification timing for analog watch -- usually by the time
  the user turns to look at the watch the beginning of the message
  has scrolled by.  Maybe have the display pause for a second or two
  before scrolling starts?
  
- Change duration of notification on analog watch -- it disappears
  too quickly.  Make it user configurable in Settings.

- Fix generic GMail notification -- sometimes we get double
  notifications, other times we get notified when the unread count
  changes because the user read an email!  Probably the easiest way to
  fix this is to remember the count of the last notification, and only
  notify the user when the count has gone *up*.
  
- Maybe try using accessibility interface to get better GMail
  notifications?  Sometimes GMail notifications include the sender
  and text of the email.

- Display anDGS notifications: "It's your turn to play!"

- Display Remember the Milk notifications: "A task is due!"

- Pandora track changes?

- Facebook notifications?

- Twitter notifications?

- Google+ notifications?

- Parcel notifications?  "Your package has arrived!" :)

- Notify on new voicemail?

- Turn-by-turn navigation?

- Low phone battery?

- Weather channel severe weather?

- Synchronize notifications being pushed to the watch at the event 
  level instead of the byte array level.  This would prevent the bug
  where simultaneous events interleave their data to the watch,
  causing confusing displays. 
  
- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?
