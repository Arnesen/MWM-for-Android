TO DO
=======================================================================




WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Optionally left-pad scrolling messages -- often the beginning of
  the message has already disappeared by the time the user looks
  at the watch

- Fix generic GMail notification -- sometimes we get double
  notifications, other times we get notified when the unread count
  changes because the user read an email!  Probably the easiest way to
  fix this is to remember the count of the last notification, and only
  notify the user when the count has gone *up*.  

- Optionally suppress toasts when Bluetooth throws IOExceptions 

- Why does clicking "Start" take so long?  Maybe we should push the
  startup to a working thread?

- Create buzzing scheme:
  - 1 buzz: minor events (music track change)
  - 2 buzz: normal events (notifications, email)
  - 3 buzz: urgent events (SMS, calendar)

- db1nto: Forward all notifications, with a blacklist?

- Scroll big text on oled?

- Scroll album and track on music updates?
  
- Display anDGS notifications: "It's your turn to play!"

- Display Remember the Milk notifications: "A task is due!"

- Pandora track changes?

- Facebook notifications?

- Twitter notifications?

- Google+ notifications?

- Parcel notifications?  "Your package has arrived!" :)

- Notify on new voicemail?

- Turn-by-turn navigation?

- Low phone battery?

- Weather channel severe weather?

- Control Winamp from watch?  Can this be done?  Does the analog
  watch have an application mode?

- Maybe try using accessibility interface to get better GMail
  notifications?  Sometimes GMail notifications include the sender
  and text of the email.

- Change duration of notification on analog watch -- it disappears
  too quickly.  Make it user configurable in Settings.
  NOTE: Notification duration might be controlled in the firmware, not 
        the MWM; look at Protocol.sendOledDisplay().  

- Synchronize notifications being pushed to the watch at the event 
  level instead of the byte array level.  This would prevent the bug
  where simultaneous events interleave their data to the watch,
  causing confusing displays.
  NOTE: Maybe this already exists?  See Notification.NotificationQueue?
  
- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?
  
- Change notification timing for analog watch -- usually by the time
  the user turns to look at the watch the beginning of the message
  has scrolled by.  Maybe have the display pause for a second or two
  before scrolling starts?
  NOTE: Scrolling behavior might be controlled in the firmware, not 
        the MWM; look at Protocol.sendOledDisplay().
