TO DO
=======================================================================


WISH LIST
=======================================================================

- Notify on new voicemail?

- Optionally left-pad scrolling text on analog, to maximize the time 
  before the beginning of the message scrolls off.

- Low phone battery?  (Already implemented by AkiraYasha -- maybe
  request permission to import their changes?)

- When the notification icon is hidden, it can sometimes be seen as
  an empty block next to other icons.  Other apps push their icon to
  the right, like Llama and Juice Defender.  How do they do that?
  Something to do with the event timestamp, maybe?

- Optionally auto-start on system boot. [tilmanb]

SOMEDAY / MAYBE
=======================================================================

- Scroll K9 receipient address on top OLED? [thescreensavers] (Not sure
  if this is possible; if it is, I probably can't tackle it until the
  analog message interface is published.) 

- Why does clicking "Start" take so long?  Maybe we should push the
  startup to a working thread?  (It doesn't do anything but start the
  service intent -- I don't think there's anything I can do to improve it.)

- Scroll big text on oled?  (Can't even attempt until we have the 
  analog watch message structure.)

- Control Winamp from watch?  Can this be done?  (Can't attempt until
  we get the analog docs -- does the analog watch have an application mode?)
